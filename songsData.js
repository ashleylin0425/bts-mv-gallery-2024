The video includes clips from the Speak Yourself: Love Yourself Tour. The boy starts out sad and lonely, but the girl comes into his life and stays with him. The video also includes references to the 1952 musical movie Singing in the Rain. The song Boy With Luv is about finding joy in the smallest things in life, and how true strength and love come from that. RM has explained that the song is about matured love, while their 2014 song Boy In Luv is about teen love."
